ðŸŒŸ Excited to share my latest project in web development! ðŸŒŸ

After earning full marks in my Human-Computer Interaction course, I decided to showcase the website interface I designed for middle school students to make learning programming both fun and engaging.

ðŸŽ¯ The Project Challenge:
I was tasked with designing an interactive website interface based on feedback from 10 middle school students. The goal was to create a platform that helps them learn programming without feeling bored.

ðŸ’¡ My Approach:
To make the experience exciting, I designed the website with a cyberpunk sci-fi theme, featuring:

Glitch effects on main titles.
Neon buttons to add a futuristic touch.
A creative background that immerses users in a unique learning environment.
